zmq_term(3)
===========


NAME
----
zmq_term - terminate 0MQ context


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_term (void '*context');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_term()_ function terminates the 0MQ context 'context'.

It does so in following steps:

* It causes any blocking operations currently in progress on sockets open within
  'context' to exit immediately with an error code of ETERM.

* With the exception of _zmq_close()_, any further operations on sockets open
  within 'context' shall fail with an error code of ETERM.

* After interrupting all blocking calls, _zmq_term()_ blocks until all sockets
  open within the context are closed using _zmq_close()_ and either all the
  pending outbound messages are pushed to the network or ZMQ_LINGER period
  expires for individual sockets.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_term()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall
return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
The provided 'context' was not valid (NULL).
